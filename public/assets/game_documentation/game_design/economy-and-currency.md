		○ Gold: The standard currency of Elytheria, used for purchasing items from vendors, upgrading equipment, and unlocking new content. Gold can be earned through various activities, such as completing quests, selling items, or participating in combat encounters.
		
		○ Arcane Essence: A rare and valuable resource used to enhance equipment, unlock powerful abilities, and craft high-tier items. Arcane Essence can be obtained by completing challenging activities, such as defeating powerful bosses, discovering hidden treasures, or mastering high-level skills.
		
	2. Gathering and Crafting: Players can gather resources and materials during their adventures in Elytheria. The value of resources will vary based on their rarity and application within the crafting and upgrading systems. Crafting will enable players to create valuable items, equipment, and consumables by combining gathered resources and materials.
	
		a. Example: A player discovers a rare ore while exploring a cave. This ore can be used to craft a powerful weapon, upgrade an existing piece of equipment, or traded to an NPC for a unique item or ability.
		
	3. Vendor and NPC Economy: Throughout Elytheria, players will encounter various vendors and NPCs offering unique goods and services in exchange for currency or resources. These NPCs will provide essential items, rare equipment, and offer unique rewards for rare resources.

	4. Upgrading and Enhancement: Players can invest their resources and currencies into upgrading their equipment, unlocking new abilities, and enhancing their character's attributes. The value of the resources will depend on the power and rarity of the upgrades and enhancements available.

		a. Example: A player finds a rare gemstone that can be used to enhance a piece of armor, providing additional defense or a unique passive effect. The player can choose to invest the gemstone in their current armor or save it for future upgrades.

	5. Treasure Hunting and Quest Rewards: The game will feature treasure hunting and questing systems, which will serve as the primary methods for obtaining valuable items, resources, and currency. Players will be encouraged to explore the world and complete quests to uncover hidden riches and powerful artifacts.

		a. Example: A player receives a treasure map from an NPC, leading them to a hidden cache of valuable resources and equipment. By following the map and solving the puzzles along the way, the player discovers a wealth of gold, rare materials, and a unique weapon.
