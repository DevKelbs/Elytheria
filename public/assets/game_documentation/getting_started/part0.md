To build an app like Melvor Idle, you should follow a structured development process that includes planning, design, development, testing, and deployment. Here's a suggested workflow to help you get started:

	1. Planning and Research: 
		a. Familiarize yourself with similar games and analyze their features and gameplay mechanics. 
		b. Determine the scope of your project and list the features and mechanics you want to include in your game.
		c. Decide on the technology stack you will use for the front-end and back-end development of your app.
		
	2. Design: 
		a. Sketch out a rough design of the user interface, including menus, buttons, and game screens. 
		b. Create detailed wireframes and mockups of the user interface using design tools like Adobe XD, Sketch, or Figma. 
		c. Design game assets such as characters, items, and backgrounds, or source them from asset stores if needed.
		
	3. Development: 
		a. Set up your development environment, including your preferred code editor, version control system (e.g., Git), and any required libraries and frameworks. 
		b. Develop the front-end user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Utilize game development libraries like Phaser.js for creating game components. 
		c. Develop the back-end server-side code using languages like PHP or Node.js and databases like MySQL or MongoDB for handling user accounts and game data storage. 
		d. Integrate the front-end and back-end components, enabling communication between the game client and server.
		
	4. Testing: 
		a. Test the game throughout the development process, fixing bugs and ensuring that gameplay mechanics are balanced and engaging.
		b. Perform user testing by inviting a group of players to try the game and provide feedback on their experience. 
		c. Optimize the game's performance, making sure it runs smoothly on different devices and browsers.
		
	5. Deployment: 
		a. Deploy the back-end server to a hosting platform like AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean. 
		b. Prepare the front-end code for production by minifying and compressing files for faster loading. 
		c. Launch the game on your chosen platform, such as a web browser, Steam, Kongregate, or mobile app stores.
		
	6. Post-launch support and updates: 
		a. Monitor the game's performance and address any technical issues that arise.
		b. Gather feedback from players and implement improvements and new features based on their suggestions.
		c. Regularly update the game with new content and features to keep players engaged.
		
By following this workflow, you can build a successful idle RPG game like Melvor Idle. Remember to stay organized and use project management tools like Trello or Asana to help you stay on track and manage your development tasks effectively.
