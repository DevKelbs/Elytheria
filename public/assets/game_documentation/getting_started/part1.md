1. Setting up OneNote

OneNote is a great tool for organizing your game documentation and world-building materials. Here's a step-by-step guide for setting up a OneNote notebook for your idle game:

	1. Create a new notebook: 
		a. Open OneNote and click on the "File" menu. 
		b. Select "New" and choose a location to save your notebook (OneDrive, local drive, etc.). 
		c. Name your notebook something descriptive, like "Idle Game Development" or "MyIdleRPG."
		
	2. Set up sections: 
		a. Create a section for each major aspect of your game. For example: "Game Design," "World Building," "Characters," "Story & Lore," "Programming & Tech," "Art & Assets," "Marketing," and "Post-Launch." 
		b. You can also create additional sections or sub-sections as needed for organization.
		
	3. Populate the sections:
	Game Design:
		○ Create a page for "Game Mechanics," detailing core gameplay elements like combat, crafting, leveling, etc.
		○ Add a page for "Progression System," explaining how players will advance through the game.
		○ Include a page for "Economy & Currency," outlining in-game currencies, shops, and the overall economy.
	World Building:
		○ Create a page for "Game World Overview," summarizing the setting and general theme.
		○ Add a page for "Locations & Zones," detailing important areas, regions, and their features.
		○ Include a page for "Factions & Organizations," describing the various groups that exist within your game world.
	Characters:
		○ Create a page for "Main Characters," including information about each character's backstory, appearance, and abilities.
		○ Add a page for "NPCs," listing important non-playable characters and their roles in the game.
		○ Include a page for "Monsters & Enemies," with descriptions and stats for various adversaries players will face.
	Story & Lore:

	Programming & Tech:
		○ Create a page for "Technology Stack," listing the languages, libraries, and frameworks you'll use.
		○ Add a page for "Code Architecture," outlining the structure of your codebase.
		○ Include a page for "APIs & Integration," describing any external tools or services you'll utilize.
	Art & Assets:
		○ Create a page for "Art Style," describing the visual aesthetic of your game.
		○ Add a page for "Asset List," keeping track of all required art assets, like characters, items, backgrounds, etc.
		○ Include a page for "Asset Management & Tools," documenting the software and methods used for asset creation and organization.
	Marketing:

	4. Customize your notebook: 
		a. Apply different colors or tags to sections, pages, or individual items to make them easier to locate. 
		b. Use collapsible lists, tables, and embedded images to organize your content effectively. 
		c. Insert hyperlinks to relevant external resources, like online tutorials, asset stores, or forums. 
		d. Take advantage of OneNote's built-in drawing tools to sketch out ideas, create diagrams, or annotate images directly in your notebook.
		
	5. Collaborate with your team: 
		a. Share your notebook with team members if you're working in a group. This allows everyone to contribute and stay up-to-date with the project's progress. 
		b. Utilize the "Comments" feature to leave notes, suggestions, or questions on specific pages or elements within the notebook.
		
By setting up a comprehensive OneNote notebook for your idle game, you'll have a centralized location to store all your documentation and world-building information. This organized approach will help streamline the development process and ensure all team members stay on the same page.
