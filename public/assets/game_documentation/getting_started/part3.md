3. Test Basic Setup

To test your basic setup and ensure that everything is working correctly, follow these steps:
	1. Create a simple "Hello, World!" page for your front-end:
a. Open your "public" folder and edit the "index.html" file to display "Hello, World!" text:

html

<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><metacharset="UTF-8"/><title>My Idle RPG</title></head><body><h1>Hello, World!</h1></body></html>
	2. Start your back-end server:
a. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project folder using the cd command. b. Run node server.js to start your Express.js server. You should see a message like "Server listening on port 3000" in the terminal.
	3. Test your front-end in the browser:
a. Open your preferred web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. b. You should see the "Hello, World!" message from your "index.html" file.
	4. Test your Socket.IO connection:
a. Open the browser's developer console (F12 on Windows/Linux, or Cmd+Opt+J on Mac) and click on the "Console" tab. b. In your "public/js/game.js" file, add a console log to display a message when the Socket.IO connection is established:

javascript

constsocket = io();
socket.on('connect', () =>{
  console.log('Connected to server');
});
c. Refresh your browser window and check the developer console. You should see the "Connected to server" message, indicating that your front-end is successfully connected to the back-end server using Socket.IO.
If all these tests are successful, it means your basic setup is working correctly. You can now start building your idle RPG game using this foundation. Remember to commit your changes to the GitHub repository and push them to the remote repository to keep your project up-to-date.
