	2. Getting Started With the Technology Stack

    
    1. Install Node.js and npm: 
		a. a. Visit the Node.js website ( https://nodejs.org/) and download the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). 
		b. b. Install Node.js following the on-screen instructions, which will also install npm (Node Package Manager).
	2. Set up your project directory: 
		a. Create a new folder for your project, e.g., "MyIdleRPG". 
		b. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project folder using the cd command. 
		c. Run npm init to initialize a new Node.js project. Follow the prompts to set up your package.json file, which will manage your project's dependencies.
	3. Install required libraries and frameworks: 
		a. Install Phaser.js for game development: npm install phaser 
		b. Install Express.js for server-side web application: npm install express 
		c. Install Socket.IO for real-time communication: npm install socket.io 
		d. Install MongoDB driver for Node.js to interact with MongoDB: npm install mongodb
	4. Set up your project structure: 
		a. Create a folder named "public" for front-end files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). 
		b. Inside the "public" folder, create subfolders "js" (for JavaScript), "css" (for CSS), and "assets" (for images, sounds, etc.). 
		c. Create an "index.html" file in the "public" folder for your game's main page. 
		d. Create a "server.js" file in the root of your project folder for the back-end server-side code.
	5. Set up the back-end server with Express.js and Socket.IO: 
		a. Open "server.js" in a code editor and add the following code to set up a basic Express.js server:

javascript:
constexpress = require('express');
constapp = express();
consthttp = require('http').Server(app);
constio = require('socket.io')(http);
app.use(express.static('public'));
constPORT= process.env.PORT|| 3000;
http.listen(PORT, () =>{
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${PORT}`);
});

		b. This code sets up an Express.js server to serve your game files from the "public" folder and initializes a Socket.IO server for real-time communication.

	6. Set up the front-end with Phaser.js: 
		a. In your "public" folder, create a new JavaScript file called "game.js" inside the "js" subfolder. 
		b. Open "game.js" in a code editor and add the following code to set up a basic Phaser.js game:

javascript:
constconfig = {
  type: Phaser.AUTO,
  width: 800,
  height: 600,
  scene: {
    preload: preload,
    create: create,
    update: update
  }
};
constgame = newPhaser.Game(config);
functionpreload() {
  // Load your game assets here}
functioncreate() {
  // Initialize your game objects here}
functionupdate() {
  // Update your game logic here
}

c. This code sets up a basic Phaser.js game template with empty preload, create, and update functions.

	7. Connect the front-end and back-end: 
		a. In your "index.html" file, add the following code to include Phaser.js, Socket.IO, and your game JavaScript file:

html:
<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><metacharset="UTF-8"/><title>My Idle RPG</title><scriptsrc="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script><scriptsrc="js/phaser.min.js"></script><scriptsrc="js/game.js"></script></head><body><!-- Your game container or other HTML elements here --></body></html>

		b. In your "game.js" file, add the following code to establish a connection with the Socket.IO server:

javascript:
constsocket = io();

Now your front-end game will be connected to the back-end server, allowing you to send and receive real-time updates between the server and clients using Socket.IO.

With this technology stack and project structure set up, you can begin developing your idle RPG game by adding game assets, designing levels, implementing game mechanics, and handling user accounts and data storage. This foundation will help you create a complex and engaging game like Melvor Idle.
