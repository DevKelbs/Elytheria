1.5 Decide Technology Stack

Based on your requirement to use the same technology stack as Melvor Idle, here's a list of technologies and tools you should use for both front-end and back-end development:

Front-end:

    HTML: For structuring the content and layout of your game's user interface.
    CSS: For styling your game's user interface, including colors, fonts, and other visual elements.
    JavaScript: For adding interactivity, handling user input, and creating dynamic behavior in your game.
    Phaser.js: A popular open-source 2D game framework built on top of WebGL and Canvas that provides pre-built components for game development, such as physics, animations, and user interface components. Phaser.js will make it easier to build and manage your game.

Back-end:

    Node.js: A server-side JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server side. This will enable you to use JavaScript for both front-end and back-end development, simplifying your technology stack.
    Express.js: A minimal web application framework for Node.js that makes it easy to set up and manage server-side APIs and routes.
    MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing game data and user information, offering flexibility and scalability.
    Socket.IO: A library for real-time communication between the server and clients, allowing for fast updates and synchronization.

To get started with this technology stack, follow these steps:

    Install Node.js on your development machine by visiting the Node.js website (https://nodejs.org/) and downloading the appropriate installer for your operating system.
    Once Node.js is installed, you can use the Node Package Manager (npm) to install Express.js, Phaser.js, Socket.IO, and any other required libraries for your project.
    Set up your project directory and initialize a new Node.js project using the npm init command.
    Start building your game's front-end and back-end components, utilizing the technologies listed above.

By using the same technology stack as Melvor Idle, you'll be better positioned to create a similar idle RPG game, leveraging the strengths of these technologies for an engaging and performant game experience.
